# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Horiseon's landing page seemingly worked however it failed to meet accessability standards. I refactored the code to make it cleaner and follow HTML semantics, as well as a logical structure. I added alt attributes for readers who have disabilities and use screen readers, and to boost the opportunity of the sites viewing.
